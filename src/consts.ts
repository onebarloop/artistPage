  homeText: `<strong>alice_d.ied</strong> is the pseudonym of Felix Thelen, a young, ambitious
  and talented artist living in Mannheim, Germany. His entire production is
  a confluence of emotions, experiences and his imaginative worlds of thought
  expressed in various art forms like paintings, plastics, NFTs, collagens,
  visuals. An intoxicated wonderland that displays a mirror of human beings
  their thoughts and how to be aware of. In his artworks he always envolves
  new dimensions of materiality and structures culminating in a sphere of fantasy
  and weirdness - inviting the recipient to dive deep into this dark but colorful
  universe of reflection, captured in multi-layered creations.`,
  aboutText: `<strong>myself as an artist</strong> - creating an universe art is more than
  putting something beautiful clean with a well known name on in your flat. creating
  art was my key to find a way of understanding myself, my mind and the people
  around me on this blue taw. recurrent emerging statements of my creations include
  awareness to yourself, your inner child and your mind. Expanding the awareness
  to the environment and the whole world in order to open up new vistas. I don't
  want to put you my glasses on, i want to transfer the feeling of mutual understanding.
  I'm creating all the time driven by infinite lines of thoughts. Everything what
  comes in my hands get turned into something completely different. That's natural
  for me, to see other possibilities in things and thoughts. I prefer the combination
  of bizarre, whimsical and weird scenarios with friendly, happy colors or vice
  versa. This is how I want to enlighten the complexity of things and have a special
  view on the glitch in life, cause nothing is free from defects. art is a way
  for me to visualize these interactions and make them accessible to the world
  - even I know my art seems sometimes very destructed and diffuse, keep at the
  back of one's mind, a picture says more than 1000 words i could use.`,
